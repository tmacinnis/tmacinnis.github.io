                        My name is Tyler MacInnis, I am a programmer and a technical support specialist.  
                        I graduated with a bachelors in computer science at a 3.4 GPA from the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth in the spring of 2017.  
                        The classes I took covered object oriented programming, procedural programming, functional programming, artificial intelligence, algorithms, and software specification and design.
                        I've been working at Electric Insurance Company since 2018 as a Technical Support Specialist. My day to day includes supporting end users and working on some backend projects in python, powershell, html, and js.
